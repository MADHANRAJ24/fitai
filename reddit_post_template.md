**Hey Developers!** 👋

I just released my first AI Fitness App, **FitAI**, and I need **20 testers** to pass the 14-day closed testing requirement.

**I will test your app in return!**
Just comment with your link and a screenshot, and I will download yours immediately and keep it installed for 14 days.

**About the App:**
FitAI is a workout tracker that uses AI to generate personalized routines and meal plans. Features include:
*   🔥 Visual Muscle Heatmaps
*   🤖 AI Chat Coach
*   📸 Food Scanner

Thanks for the help! Let's get published together. 🚀
